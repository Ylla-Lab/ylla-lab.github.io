The **Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Genome Biology** led by Dr. [Guillem Ylla](https://guillemylla.github.io) is part of the [Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Biotechnology](https://wbbib.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start-en) of the [Jagiellonian University](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start) in Krakow (Poland).



Lab Mission
======

The overarching goal of the laboratory is to use computational approaches to study genes, genomes, and gene regulatory networks. Keeping always an evolutionary perspective, we aim to understand how genomes produce different phenotype, and especially, how phenotypic innovations have emerged and evolved. 


Research
======

Our research expertise is on analyzing and integrating "omics data" to answer question biologically relevant questions on the fields of evolution and development. 

Facilities
======

The laboratory is composed of a wet-lab area for performing perform molecular biology experiments and a large office for computational work. The laboratory has also its own computing cluster with 160 cores (320 threads), 640 Gb of RAM (in the process to expand it to 1.5Tb) and ~20Tb of disk storage.

The Team
======

The research group is formed by a talented group of international scientists at different levels of their careers with a common interest on applying computational methods to understand biology. Know more about them on the [People's page](https://ylla-laboratory.github.io/people/).
