The **Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Genome Biology** lead by Dr. [Guillem Ylla](https://guillemylla.github.io) is part of the [Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Biotechnology](https://wbbib.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start-en) of Jagiellonian University.

The overarching goal of the laboratory is to use computational approaches to study genes, genomes, and gene regulatory networks. Keeping always an evolutionary perspective, we aim to understand how genomes produce different phenotypes, and especially, how phenotypic innovations have emerged and evolved.
