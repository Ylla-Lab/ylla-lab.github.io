abstract = {The survival and evolution of a species is a function of the number of offspring it can produce. In insects the number of eggs that an ovary can produce is a major determinant of reproductive capacity. Insect ovaries are made up of tubular egg-producing subunits called ovarioles, whose number largely determines the number of eggs that can be potentially laid. Ovariole number is directly determined by the number of cellular structures called terminal filaments, which are stacks of cells that assemble in the larval ovary. Elucidating the developmental and regulatory mechanisms of terminal filament formation is thus key to understanding the regulation of insect reproduction through ovariole number regulation. We systematically measured mRNA expression of all cells in the larval ovary at the beginning, middle and end of terminal filament formation. We also separated somatic and germ line cells during these stages and assessed their tissue-specific gene expression during larval ovary development. We found that the number of differentially expressed somatic genes is highest during late stages of terminal filament formation and includes many signaling pathways that govern ovary development. We also show that germ line tissue, in contrast, shows greater differential expression during early stages of terminal filament formation, and highly expressed germ line genes at these stages largely control cell division and DNA repair. We provide a tissue-specific and temporal transcriptomic dataset of gene expression in the developing larval ovary as a resource to study insect reproduction.},

abstract = {Germ line specification is essential in sexually reproducing organisms. Despite their critical role, the evolutionary history of the genes that specify animal germ cells is heterogeneous and dynamic. In many insects, the gene oskar is required for the specification of the germ line. However, the germ line role of oskar is thought to be a derived role resulting from co-option from an ancestral somatic role. To address how evolutionary changes in protein sequence could have led to changes in the function of Oskar protein that enabled it to regulate germ line specification, we searched for oskar orthologs in 1565 publicly available insect genomic and transcriptomic datasets. The earliest-diverging lineage in which we identified an oskar ortholog was the order Zygentoma (silverfish and firebrats), suggesting that oskar originated before the origin of winged insects. We noted some order-specific trends in oskar sequence evolution, including whole gene duplications, clade-specific losses, and rapid divergence. An alignment of all known 379 Oskar sequences revealed new highly conserved residues as candidates that promote dimerization of the LOTUS domain. Moreover, we identified regions of the OSK domain with conserved predicted RNA binding potential. Furthermore, we show that despite a low overall amino acid conservation, the LOTUS domain shows higher conservation of predicted secondary structure than the OSK domain. Finally, we suggest new key amino acids in the LOTUS domain that may be involved in the previously reported Oskar-Vasa physical interaction that is required for its germ line role.},

abstract = {In the recent years, an important renewal of apricot cultivars is taking place worldwide with the introduction of a large number of new releases, which are replacing traditional and local cultivars in many situations. To study the current genetic diversity, a group of 202 apricot accessions, including landraces and releases from breeding programs in several countries, has been characterized using 13 microsatellite markers. The diversity parameters showed higher diversity in modern releases than in landraces, but also suggested a loss of diversity associated with recent breeding. Two main clusters according to the pedigree origin of the accessions were clearly differentiated in the phylogenetic analysis based on Nei's genetic distance. The first group comprised mostly European and North American traditional cultivars, and the second group included the majority of recent and commercial releases from breeding programs. Further population analyses showed the same clustering trend on the distribution of individuals and clusters, confirming the results obtained in the molecular phylogenetic analysis. These results provide a sight of the erosion and the decrease of the genetic diversity in the currently grown apricot and highlight the importance of preserve traditional cultivars and local germplasm to assure genetic resources for further breeding.},

abstract = {Motivation: microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential components of gene expression regulation at the post-transcriptional level. miRNAs have a well-defined molecular structure and this has facilitated the development of computational and high-throughput approaches to predict miRNAs genes. However, due to their short size, miRNAs have often been incorrectly annotated in both plants and animals. Consequently, published miRNA annotations and miRNA databases are enriched for false miRNAs, jeopardizing their utility as molecular information resources. To address this problem, we developed MirCure, a new software for quality control, filtering and curation of miRNA candidates. MirCure is an easy-to-use tool with a graphical interface that allows both scoring of miRNA reliability and browsing of supporting evidence by manual curators. Results: Given a list of miRNA candidates, MirCure evaluates a number of miRNA-specific features based on gene expression, biogenesis and conservation data, and generates a score that can be used to discard poorly supported miRNA annotations. MirCure can also curate and adjust the annotation of the 5p and 3p arms based on user-provided small RNA-seq data. We evaluated MirCure on a set of manually curated animal and plant miRNAs and demonstrated great accuracy. Moreover, we show that MirCure can be used to revisit previous bona fide miRNAs annotations to improve miRNA databases. Availability and implementation: The MirCure software and all the additional scripts used in this project are publicly available at https://github.com/ConesaLab/MirCure. A Docker image of MirCure is available at https://hub.docker. com/r/conesalab/mircure.},

By 29 Feb 2020, the number of discharged patients was 41,625, which exceeded the number of hospitalized patients, and the trend has further increased. The infection of the SARS-COV-2 is spreading and increasing nationwide, and Hubei Province is the main epidemic area, with higher mortality. The outbreak is now under initial control especially in other regions outside of Hubei Province.

abstract = {Background: Do miRNAs contribute to specify the germ-band type and the body structure in the insect embryo? Our goal was to address that issue by studying the changes in miRNA expression along the ontogeny of the German cockroach Blattella germanica, which is a short germ-band and hemimetabolan species. Results: We sequenced small RNA libraries representing 11 developmental stages of B. germanica ontogeny (with especial emphasis on embryogenesis) and the changes in miRNA expression were examined. Data were compared with equivalent data for two long germ-band holometabolan species Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis, and the short germ-band holometabolan species Tribolium castaneum. The identification of B. germanica embryo small RNA sequences unveiled miRNAs not detected in previous studies, such as those of the MIR-309 family and 54 novel miRNAs. Four main waves of miRNA expression were recognized (with most miRNA changes occurring during the embryonic stages): the first from day 0 to day 1 of embryogenesis, the second during mid-embryogenesis (days 0-6), the third (with an acute expression peak) on day 2 of embryonic development, and the fourth during post-embryonic development. The second wave defined the boundaries of maternal-to-zygotic transition, with maternal mRNAs being cleared, presumably by Mir-309 and associated scavenger miRNAs. Conclusion: miRNAs follow well-defined patterns of expression over hemimetabolan ontogeny, patterns that are more diverse during embryonic development than during the nymphal stages. The results suggest that miRNAs play important roles in the developmental transitions between the embryonic stages of development (starting with maternal loading), during which they might influence the germ-band type and metamorphosis mode.},

abstract = {Summary The success of neopteran insects, with 1 million species described, is associated with developmental innovations like the holometaboly and the evolution from short to long germ-band embryogenesis. To unveil the mechanisms underlining these innovations, we compared gene expression during the ontogeny of two extreme neopterans, the cockroach Blattella germanica (polyneopteran, hemimetabolan and short germ-band species), and the fly Drosophila melanogaster (endopterygote, holometabolan and long germ-band species). Results revealed that genes associated with metamorphosis are predominantly expressed in late nymphal stages in B. germanica and in early-mid embryo in D. melanogaster. In B. germanica the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT) concentrates early in embryogenesis, when juvenile hormone factors are significantly expressed. In D. melanogaster, the MZT extends throughout embryogenesis, during which juvenile hormone factors appear unimportant. These differences possibly reflect broad trends in the evolution of development within neopterans, related to the germ-band type and the metamorphosis mode.},

abstract = {In the endopterygote Drosophila melanogaster, Zelda is an activator of the zygotic genome during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Zelda binds cis-regulatory elements (TAGteam heptamers), making chromatin accessible for gene transcription. Zelda has been studied in other endopterygotes: Apis mellifera and Tribolium castaneum, and the paraneopteran Rhodnius prolixus. We studied Zelda in the cockroach Blattella germanica, a hemimetabolan, short germ-band, and polyneopteran species. B. germanica Zelda has the complete set of functional domains, which is typical of species displaying ancestral features concerning embryogenesis. Interestingly, we found D. melanogaster TAGteam heptamers in the B. germanica genome. The canonical one, CAGGTAG, is present at a similar proportion in the genome of these two species and in the genome of other insects, suggesting that the genome admits as many CAGGTAG motifs as its length allows. Zelda-depleted embryos of B. germanica show defects involving blastoderm formation and abdomen development, and genes contributing to these processes are down-regulated. We conclude that in B. germanica, Zelda strictly activates the zygotic genome, within the MZT, a role conserved in more derived endopterygote insects. In B. germanica, zelda is expressed during MZT, whereas in D. melanogaster and T. castaneum it is expressed beyond this transition. In these species and A. mellifera, Zelda has functions even in postembryonic development. The expansion of zelda expression beyond the MZT in endopterygotes might be related with the evolutionary innovation of holometabolan metamorphosis. Databases: The RNA-seq datasets of B. germanica, D. melanogaster, and T. castaneum are accessible at the GEO databases GSE99785, GSE18068, GSE63770, and GSE84253.

As a disease vector and producer of allergens, this species has major health and economic impacts on humans. Factors contributing to the success of the German cockroach include its resistance to a broad range of insecticides, immunity to many pathogens, and its ability, as an extreme generalist omnivore, to survive on most food sources. The recently published genome shows that B. germanica has an exceptionally high number of protein coding genes. In this study, we investigate the functions of the 93 significantly expanded gene families with the aim to better understand the success of B. germanica as a major pest despite such inhospitable conditions. We find major expansions in gene families with functions related to the detoxification of insecticides and allelochemicals, defense against pathogens, digestion, sensory perception, and gene regulation. These expansions might have allowed B. germanica to develop multiple resistance mechanisms to insecticides and pathogens, and enabled a broad, flexible diet, thus explaining its success in unsanitary conditions and under recurrent chemical control. The findings and resources presented here provide insights for better understanding molecular mechanisms that will facilitate more effective cockroach control.},

However, relevant particularities, both in mechanism and function, exist across species among metazoans and even within the insect class. As a member of the scarcely studied hemimetabolan group, Blattella germanica can be a suitable reference model to study insect evolution. We present the results of a stringent process of identification and study of expressed piRNAs for B. germanica across 11 developmental stages, ranging from unfertilized egg to nymphs and adult female. Our results confirm the dual origin of piRNA in this species, with a majority of them being generated from the primary pathway, and a smaller but highly expressed set of sequences participating in the secondary (“ping-pong”) reamplification pathway. An intriguing partial complementarity in expression is observed between the piRNA of the two biogenesis pathways, with those generated in the secondary pathway being quite restricted to early embryo stages. In addition, many piRNAs are exclusively expressed in late embryo and nymphal stages. These observations point at piRNA functions beyond the role of transposon control in early embryogenesis. Our work supports the view of a more complex scenario, with different sets of piRNAs acting in different times and having a range of functions wider than previously thought.},

Exhibiting extraordinary levels of morphological and developmental complexity, insects are the most diverse animal class on earth. Their evolutionary success was in particular shaped by the innovation of holometabolan metamorphosis in endopterygotes. Previously, miRNA evolution had been linked to morphological complexity, but astonishing variation in the currently available miRNA complements of insects made this link unclear. To address this issue, we sequenced the miRNA complement of the hemimetabolan Blattella germanica and reannotated that of two other hemimetabolan species, Locusta migratoria and Acyrthosiphon pisum, and of four holometabolan species, Apis mellifera, Tribolium castaneum, Bombyx mori and Drosophila melanogaster. Our analyses show that the variation of insect miRNAs is an artefact mainly resulting from poor sampling and inaccurate miRNA annotation, and that insects share a conserved microRNA toolkit of 65 families exhibiting very low variation. For example, the evolutionary shift toward a complete metamorphosis was accompanied only by the acquisition of three and the loss of one miRNA families.},

abstract = {The tergal gland is a structure exclusive of adult male cockroaches that produces substances attractive to the female and facilitates mating. It is formed de novo in tergites 7 and 8 during the transition from the last nymphal instar to the adult. Thus, the tergal gland can afford a suitable case study to investigate the molecular basis of a morphogenetic process occurring during metamorphosis. Using Blattella germanica as model, we constructed transcriptomes from male tergites 7-8 in non-metamorphosing specimens, and from the same tergites in metamorphosing specimens. We performed a de novo assembly all available transcriptomes to construct a reference transcriptome and we identified transcripts by homology. Finally we mapped all reads into the reference transcriptome in order to perform analysis of differentially expressed genes and a GO-enrichment test. A total of 5622 contigs appeared to be overrepresented in the transcriptome of metamorphosing specimens with respect to those specimens that did not metamorphose. Among these genes, there were six GO-terms with a p-value lower than 0.05 and among them GO: 0003676 ("nucleic acid binding") was especially interesting since it included transcription factors (TFs). Examination of TF-Pfam-motifs revealed that the transcriptome of metamorphosing specimens contains the highest diversity of these motifs, with 29 different types (seven of them exclusively expressed in this stage) compared with that of non-metamorphosing specimens, which contained 24 motif types. Transcriptome comparisons suggest that TFs are important drivers of the process of tergal gland formation during metamorphosis.},

In contrast, Hemimetabolous insects undergo the presumed ancestral process of incomplete metamorphosis, and have larger genomes with high levels of DNA methylation. Hemimetabolous species from the Orthopteran order (grasshoppers and crickets) have some of the largest known insect genomes. What drives the evolution of these unusual insect genome sizes, remains unknown. Here we report the sequencing, assembly and annotation of the 1.66-Gb genome of the Mediterranean field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus , and the annotation of the 1.60-Gb genome of the Hawaiian cricket Laupala kohalensis . We compare these two cricket genomes with those of 14 additional insects and find evidence that hemimetabolous genomes expanded due to transposable element activity. Based on the ratio of observed to expected CpG sites, we find higher conservation and stronger purifying selection of methylated genes than non-methylated genes. Finally, our analysis suggests an expansion of the pickpocket class V gene family in crickets, which we speculate might play a role in the evolution of cricket courtship, including their characteristic chirping.},

abstract = {Background: RNA interference (RNAi) is a cellular mechanism used to fight various threats, including transposons, aberrant RNAs, and some types of viruses. This mechanism relies on the detection of dsRNA molecules, which through a pathway involving Dicer-2 (Dcr-2) and Argonaute 2 (AGO2), produces small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that bind to the complementary RNAs triggering their degradation. Methods: Using the cockroach Blattella germanica as a model, we examined AGO2 activity by depleting its mRNA using RNAi and analyzing the phenotypes produced. Results: Depleting AGO2 expression had no remarkable effect on nymphal development or reproduction. dsRNA treatment triggered an immediate and transitory increase in AGO2 expression, independently of Dcr-2 action. In addition, we analyzed the siRNAs generated after injecting a heterologous dsRNA in control and AGO2-depleted animals. The results revealed that obtained siRNAs mapped non-uniformly along the dsRNA sequence. In AGO2-depleted animals, the proportion of 22 nucleotide reads was higher and accumulations of reads appeared in areas less well-represented in the controls. We also detected a preference for cytosine as the first nucleotide in controls that was significantly attenuated in AGO2-depleted individuals. Conclusions/general significance: The siRNAs produced from a dsRNA mapped heterogeneously along the length of the dsRNA and this arrangement depends on the dsRNA sequence. AGO2 exerts its role as nuclease on the siRNA duplexes independently of its action on the corresponding mRNA. This study sheds light on an extremely useful process for reverse genetics in laboratories, in addition to the design of more effective, specific, and eco-friendly pest-control strategies.},

@article{Harrison2018,
abstract = {Around 150 million years ago, eusocial termites evolved from within the cockroaches, 50 million years before eusocial Hymenoptera, such as bees and ants, appeared. Here, we report the 2-Gb genome of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, and the 1.3-Gb genome of the drywood termite Cryptotermes secundus. We show evolutionary signatures of termite eusociality by comparing the genomes and transcriptomes of three termites and the cockroach against the background of 16 other eusocial and non-eusocial insects. Dramatic adaptive changes in genes underlying the production and perception of pheromones confirm the importance of chemical communication in the termites. These are accompanied by major changes in gene regulation and the molecular evolution of caste determination. Many of these results parallel molecular mechanisms of eusocial evolution in Hymenoptera. However, the specific solutions are remarkably different, thus revealing a striking case of convergence in one of the major evolutionary transitions in biological complexity.},
